Predict flooding events using machine learning! This takes rainfall discharges and gage height data to forecast flood severity. Users can input discharge, gage height, and rainfall to get predictions. It is perfect for student skills in tackling real-world challenges. 

Here are five key features of my project:
1. Real-time Prediction: Users can input current rainfall discharge, gage height, and rainfall data to receive an immediate flood prediction, providing valuable insights for flood preparedness.

2.Interactive Interface: The app offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface where users can easily input data and visualize flood predictions, enhancing user engagement and understanding.

3.Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and make accurate predictions about flooding severity, showcasing the power of AI in solving real-world problems.

4. Customizable Parameters: Allows users to adjust prediction parameters such as time frame and geographical location, providing flexibility and customization based on specific needs and scenarios.

5. Educational Resources: Provides educational resources and explanations about flood prediction methods and the importance of early warning systems, empowering users to make informed decisions and take proactive measures against flooding risks.
